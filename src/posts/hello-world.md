Welcome to my blog! I'm Jon, a mathematics major and full-stack developer. This is where I'll share thoughts on math, computer science, AI/ML, and whatever else catches my interest.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Mathematics** — PDEs, dynamical systems, and the beauty of abstract algebra
- **AI/ML** — multi-agent systems, LLMs, and practical applications
- **Full-stack development** — SvelteKit, Go, Python, and building real things
- **Random explorations** — history, philosophy, game dev, and Minecraft servers

## Why a Blog?

Writing forces clarity. If I can explain something well enough to put it in a post, I probably understand it. And if I don't, the writing process helps me get there.

Stay tuned for more.
